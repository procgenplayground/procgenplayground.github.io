IT guy with (mostly) useless CS degree.  I've always been interested in procedural generation and world building.  This blog is brain dumps and random thoughts about various half-finished projects and half-baked ideas I half-heartedly work on in-between Overwatch matches or whenever I get bored with the current rogue-like I'm playing.
